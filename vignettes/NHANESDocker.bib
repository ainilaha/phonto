  abstract = {Various heavy metal elements in the human body have been reported to be associated with dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes. The role of cobalt in these conditions is unclear. The current study aimed to investigate the association of blood cobalt concentrations with dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes., Using the data collected from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2015-2018), we performed logistic regression to explore the association of blood cobalt concentrations with total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides, hypertension, and diabetes., A total of 6866 adults were included in this study. Participants with higher blood cobalt levels appeared to be older and have a lower body mass index and, were more likely to be female (P for trend{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}.05). After fully adjusting for demographic characteristics (Model 2), compared with the lowest quartile, the highest quartile of blood cobalt concentrations had lower odds ratios (ORs) for elevated TC [OR: 0.62, 95\% confidential interval (CI): 0.53 to 0.72, P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}.001], elevated LDL-C (OR: 0.65, 95\% CI: 0.53-0.80, P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}.001) and low HDL-C (OR: 0.81, 95\% CI: 0.69-0.96, P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}.013). The adjusted ORs for elevated TC, elevated LDL-C and low HDL-C were negatively correlated with increased blood cobalt concentrations (P for trend{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}.05). The adjusted ORs for hypertension and diabetes were not associated with blood cobalt concentrations (P{$\mkern1mu>\mkern1mu$}.05 and P for trend{$\mkern1mu>\mkern1mu$}.05)., In conclusion, higher blood cobalt concentrations were associated with a lower risk of dyslipidemia. However, blood cobalt concentrations were not associated with the risk of hypertension or diabetes.},

  abstract = {Something fundamental to computation-based research has really changed in the last 10 years. In certain fields, progress is simply dramatically faster than ever. Researchers in affected fields are living through a period of profound transformation as the fields undergo a transition to frictionless reproducibility (FR). This transition markedly changes the rate at which ideas and practices spread, affects scientific mindsets and the goals of science, and erases memories of much that came before.The emergence of FR flows from three data science principles that matured together after decades of work by many technologists and numerous research communities. The mature principles involve data sharing, code sharing, and competitive challenges, however implemented in the particularly strong form of frictionless open services.Empirical machine learning is today's leading adherent field; its hidden superpower is adherence to frictionless reproducibility practices; these practices are responsible for the striking and surprising progress in AI that we see everywhere; and these practices can be learned and adhered to by researchers in any research field, automatically increasing the rate of progress in each adherent field.},

  abstract = {It is important, if not essential, to integrate the computations and code used in data analyses, methodological descriptions, simulations, and so on with the documents that describe and rely on them. This integration allows readers to both verify and adapt the claims in the documents. Authors can easily reproduce the results in the future, and they can present the document's contents in a different medium, for example, with interactive controls. This article describes a software framework for both authoring and distributing these integrated, dynamic documents that contain text, code, data, and any auxiliary content needed to recreate the computations. The documents are dynamic in that the contents---including figures, tables, and so on---can be recalculated each time a view of the document is generated. Our model treats a dynamic document as a master or "source" document from which one can generate different views in the form of traditional, derived documents for different audiences. We introduce the concept of a compendium as a container for one or more dynamic documents and the different elements needed when processing them, such as code and data. The compendium serves as a means for distributing, managing, and updating the collection. The step from disseminating analyses via a compendium to reproducible research is a small one. By reproducible research, we mean research papers with accompanying software tools that allow the reader to directly reproduce the results and employ the computational methods that are presented in the research paper. Some of the issues involved in paradigms for the production, distribution, and use of such reproducible research are discussed.}

Uberon provides a necessary bridge between anatomical structures in different taxa for cross-species inference.
