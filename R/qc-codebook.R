## QC based on codebook metadata for one variable at a time. The main
## goal is to detect and report inconsistencies in a variable within
## or across cycles. By default, the variable is looked for in all
## cycles, but specific cycles may also be specified
## (QuestionnaireDescriptions has BeginYear and EndYear for each
## table)

## The specific types of discrepancies we look for are:

## - Whether appears in multiple tables in a given cycle

## - Inconsistency in Description / SasLabel (mostly benign)

## - Inconsistency in type (numeric / categorical)

## - Inconsistency in levels for categorical variables (capitalization / other)

## - Presence of 'special' values in numeric variables, and
##   inconsistency in them (including different codes for same
##   value). Should have option to exclude common examples like "Don't
##   know", "Refused", etc.

## - Data coarsening (this may be tricky to identify)

## - Whether variable may be skipped. This requires preparing an
##   initial table-level summary.

## For variables appearing in multiple tables in the same cycle, an
## additional check could be to see if it records the same data. This
## should be a separate check, as it involves accessing the actual
## data.
